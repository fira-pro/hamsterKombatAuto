## What This Code Can Do

- **Collect passive coins**: Automatically collects passively generated coins every 3 hours based on the _profit per hour_ rate‚è≤Ô∏è.
- **Claim daily streaküìÜ**: Automatically claims the daily streak bonus. The streak resets to day 1 after 10 days and a 5M coin bonus.
- **Daily cipher**: Automatically solves and claims the daily Morse code cipher bonus, using the code available in the API response.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications to a specified Telegram bot with details of the collected coins.
- **Multiple accounts**: Supports multiple Telegram accounts. See the [access_tokens.json](access_tokens.json) file for setup.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement feature to receive the daily combo card list and claim a 5M coin bonusüî•.

## How to use

- **_To use this code_**:

  - Obtain the **Authorization token** used by the Hamster Kombat API. This requires performing a **Man In The Middle (MITM)** attack on the Telegram app while interacting with the Hamster Kombat bot miniApp.
  You can achieve this using any Android emulator with ADB enabled and root access in conjunction with HTTP Toolkit. Follow HTTP Toolkit's guide [here](https://httptoolkit.com/docs/guides/android/). (A detailed tutorial will be added soonüòÑ)
