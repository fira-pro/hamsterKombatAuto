## What This Code Can Do

- **Collect passive coins**: collect passively generated coins by _profit per hour_ every 3 hours‚è≤Ô∏è
- **Claim dailyüìÜ streak**: claim daily streak bonus of the day. After 10 days and 5M coin bonus, resets back to day 1.
- **Daily cipher**: solve and claim the daily morse cipher. Because the cipher code is available inside the API response, it can be decoded easily
- **Notification**: send notification about the result using Telegram bot
- **Multiple account**: support multiple telegram account. see [access_tokens](access_tokens.json) file

## TODO

- [ ] Add the ability to receive list of daily combo cards and claim 5M coinsüî•

## How to use

- To use this code:

  - you need to get **Authorization** token used by Hamster Kombat API by doing **MITM**(Man In The Middle) on telegram app while opening the Hamster Kombat bot miniApp.
    For this, You can use an any android emulator with adb enabled and root access with HTTP Toolkit. refer HTTP Toolkit's guide [here](https://httptoolkit.com/docs/guides/android/). (I will include tutorial soonüòÑ)
